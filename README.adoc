= Presentations

by Patrick van Dissel

See the `subprojects` directory for the overview of presentations.

== Usage

The presentations are set-up with http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]
and generated to usable formats, like html5, with http://gradle.org[Gradle]
using the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/[asciidoctor-gradle-plugin].

To build the presentations run the following command:

....
$ ./gradlew presentation
....

Each presentation is a separate Gradle subproject, located within the `subprojects` directory.
To build only a specific presentation, run the following command:

....
$ ./gradlew :{name-of-subproject}:presentation
....

The generated presentation output can be found, per subproject, in the `build/asciidoc/{format}/`.
