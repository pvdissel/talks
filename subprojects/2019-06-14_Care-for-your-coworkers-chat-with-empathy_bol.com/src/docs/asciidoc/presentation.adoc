* Every thread has it's own context
* First message defines context
* Reuse threads

[state=white-on-white, background-video="{imagesdir}/got-idea.mp4", background-video-muted=true,background-size=cover]
== Tips for users

* Read the room name/topic
* Search for threads with similar issues
* Start a new thread if no similar issue
* Don't distract people unnessesarily
* Provide full context in first message
* Use the support rooms for support!

[state=white-on-white, background-video="{imagesdir}/meerkat-standing.mp4", background-video-muted=true,background-size=cover]
== Don't use *@all*

unless you're the owner of the room, +
informing your users

[state=white-on-white, background-video="{imagesdir}/thinking-idea.mp4", background-video-muted=true,background-size=cover]
=== Tips for room owners

* Use informative room name/topic, including
** Context of room (eg. opex list)
** Who to contact for support
* Provide support *only* in the support rooms
