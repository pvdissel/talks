"Spock is a testing and specification framework
 for Java and Groovy applications. What makes it stand
 out from the crowd is its beautiful and
 highly expressive specification language."
-- Spock Framework Reference Documentation, http://docs.spockframework.org


== !

"Thanks to its JUnit runner, Spock is compatible
 with most IDEs, build tools, and continuous integration servers.
 Spock is inspired from
 JUnit, jMock, RSpec, Groovy, Scala,
 Vulcans, and other fascinating life forms."
-- Spock Framework Reference Documentation, http://docs.spockframework.org

Lets start-off with some samples of Spock Specifications
to get used to it.

For each sample,
think for yourself,
what you expect the specification does.

After the samples, I will explain how this all works

== Spock Primer

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's start at the beginning
--


=== Characteristics

[%step]
- GroovyDSL
- `Sputnik`, Spock’s JUnit runner
- Works for Java and Groovy code

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- GroovyDSL,
Specifications, or Specs for short
Are written in Groovy,
with additional Domain Specific Language syntax
for the Specification domain.

Spocks internals are pure Java,
and therefor JVM-language agnostic.
But the GroovyDSL ties it to the
Groovy language for the specifications.

- Junit Runner,
Spocks specifications are runned with
Spock's JUnit runner, called `Sputnik`.
Because of this, Spock integrates with
every tool that supports JUnit.
But as Spock supports way more than
Junit, the integration may not be always
be optimal.

- Works for Java and Groovy code,
Groovy is a multi-faceted language for the JVM
and can largely be viewed as a superset of Java.
Therefor Groovy is easy to learn for Java developers,
and makes it possible
to test Java and Groovy code with Spock
--


=== Characteristics

[%step]
- Specification-based +
  (Specification by Example? BDD?)
- Data Driven Testing +
  with data providers and tables
- Interaction Based Testing +
  with build-in support for +
  mocking, stubbing and spying

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Specification-based,
Spock is Specification-based,
You can also call it
Specification-by-Example
or Behaviour Driven Development.

The idea is, that you describe
how you expect the
System-under-Specification, to react.

As you've seen in the samples,
the Specification DSL is very expressive,
but you're not forced to go all the way

- Data Driven Testing,
The Specification DSL has a specific
syntax for data providers
and even tables to acts as data providers

- Interaction Based Testing,
Spock includes a mocking, stubbing and
spying framework
which is lenient by default, like Mockito
and can be as powerful as PowerMock
--


=== Imports

[source,groovy]
----
import spock.lang.*
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Package `spock.lang` contains the most
important types for writing specifications.
--


=== Specification

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/MyFirstSpec.groovy[tags=slide]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
A specification is represented as a
Groovy class that extends from `spock.lang.Specification`.

The name of a specification usually relates to the
system or system operation described
by the specification.

For example, `CustomerSpec`, `H264VideoPlayback`,
and `ASpaceshipAttackedFromTwoSides`
are all reasonable names for a specification.

There are no standards to the specification
class name, no required "Test" on a specific
location in the name.
Just extend from `Specification`
--


=== Instance Fields

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/InstanceFields.groovy[tags=instance]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Instance fields are a good place to store objects belonging
to the specification's fixture. It is good practice to
initialize them right at the point of declaration.
Or in the equivalent `setup()` method.

Objects stored into instance fields are
_not_ shared between feature methods.
Instead, every feature method gets its own object.
This helps to isolate feature methods from each other.
--


=== Shared Fields

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/InstanceFields.groovy[tags=shared]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Sometimes you need to share an object between feature methods.
For example, the object might be very expensive to create,
or you might want your feature methods to interact with each other.
To achieve this, declare a `@Shared` field.
Again it's best to initialize the field right at the point of declaration.
Or in the equivalent `setupSpec()` method.
--


=== Static Fields

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/InstanceFields.groovy[tags=static]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Static fields should only be used for constants.
Otherwise shared fields are preferable,
because their semantics with respect to sharing are more well-defined.
--


=== Fixture Methods

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/FixtureMethods.groovy[tags=slide]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Fixture methods are responsible for
setting up and cleaning up the environment in which feature methods are run.

Usually it's a good idea to use a
fresh fixture for every feature method,
which is what the `setup()` and `cleanup()`
methods are for.

Occasionally it makes sense for feature methods to share a fixture,
which is achieved by using shared fields
together with the `setupSpec()` and `cleanupSpec()` methods.
All fixture methods are optional.

Note: The `setupSpec()` and `cleanupSpec()` methods may not reference non-shared instance fields.
--


=== Feature Methods

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/FeatureMethods.groovy[tags=slide]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Feature methods are the heart of a specification.
They describe the features that you expect to
find in the system under specification.
By convention, feature methods are named with String literals. Try to choose
good names for your feature methods, and feel free to use any characters you like!
--


=== Feature Methods

Phases::
. Set up the feature's fixture
. Provide a *_stimulus_* to the system under specification
. Describe the *_response_* expected from the system
. Clean up the feature's fixture

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Conceptually, a feature method consists of four phases:

. Set up the feature's fixture
. Provide a *_stimulus_* to the system under specification
. Describe the *_response_* expected from the system
. Clean up the feature's fixture

Whereas the first and last phases are optional,
the stimulus and response phases are always present
and may occur more than once.
--


== Blocks

image::Blocks2Phases.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Spock has built-in support for implementing each of
the conceptual phases of a feature method.

A feature method must have at least one explicit
(i.e. labelled) block.
Blocks divide a method into distinct sections,
and cannot be nested.
--


=== Setup Blocks

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
setup:
def stack = new Stack()
----

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
given:
def stack = new Stack()
----

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
def stack = new Stack()
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The `setup` block is where you do any setup work
for the feature that you are describing.

It is an optional block
and has no special semantics.

The `given:` label is an alias to the `setup:` label
--


=== When and Then Blocks

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
when:   // stimulus
then:   // response
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The `when` and `then` blocks always occur together.
They describe a stimulus and the expected response.
Whereas `when` blocks may contain arbitrary code,
`then` blocks are restricted to
_conditions_,
_exception conditions_,
_interactions_,
and variable definitions.
A feature method may contain multiple pairs of `when-then` blocks.
--


=== Conditions

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/SamplesSpec.groovy[tag=slide2]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Conditions describe an expected state,
much like JUnit's assertions.
However, conditions are written as plain boolean expressions,
according to the Groovy-truth.
Eliminating the need for explicit assertions.
--


=== Condition Feedback

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
Condition not satisfied:

stack.size() == 2
|     |      |
|     1      false
[push me]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
As you can see, Spock captures all values produced
during the evaluation of a condition,
and presents them in an easily digestible form.

And in IntelliJ you can see a diff
between the values.
Where `stack.size()` is the actual value,
and the `2` is the expected value.
--


=== Exception Conditions

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/SamplesSpec.groovy[tag=slide4]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Exception conditions are used to describe that
a `when` block should throw an exception.

There's the `thrown()` and `notThrown`
--


=== Expect Blocks


[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
expect:
Math.max(1, 2) == 2
----

*vs*

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
when:
def x = Math.max(1, 2)

then:
x == 2
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
An `expect` block is more limited than a `then` block,
in that it may only contain conditions and variable definitions.

It is useful in situations where it is
more natural to describe stimulus
and expected response in a single expression.

As a guideline, use
`when-then` to describe methods with side effects,
and `expect` to describe purely functional methods.
--


=== Helper Methods

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/HelperMethods.groovy[tag=slide]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If you factor out implicit conditions to helper methods,
you must make the conditions explicit,
with the `assert` keyword
--


== Specifications as Documentation

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/SamplesSpec.groovy[tag=slide7]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Well-written specifications are a valuable source of information,
and can provide a Behaviour Driven Development style specification.
--


=== BDD-style Reports

https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports[`spock-reports`] extension for BDD-style reports::
- http://codepen.io/renatoathaydes/full/ihGgt[Feature Report]
- http://codepen.io/renatoathaydes/full/mKckz[Summary Report]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Block descriptions are not only present in source code,
but are also available to the Spock runtime.
Currently, Spock doesn't do anything with these.
But this will change.
The `spock-reports` extension used this for BDD-style reports,
and will probably be included into a future Spock release
--

== Data Driven Testing

image::minions-awesome.gif[background, size=cover]

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/SamplesSpec.groovy[tag=slide6]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
A `where` block always comes last in a method, and may not be repeated.
It is used to write data-driven feature methods.

For all details, check the "Data Driven Testing"
chapter of the Spock documentation.
--


== Interaction Based Testing

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sources}/test/groovy/com/bol/spock/sample/SamplesSpec.groovy[tag=slide5]
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Whereas conditions describe an object's state,
interactions describe how objects communicate with each other.

This is what you test with mocking, stubbing and spying.
For all details, check the "Interaction Based Testing"
chapter of the Spock documentation.
--

== Extensions

image::minions-shake-light.gif[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Spock is very extensible.
Some bundled extensions, are..
--


=== Ignore / Require

[source,groovy]
----
@spock.lang.Ignore("Reason")
def "my feature"() { ... }
----

[source,groovy]
----
@spock.lang.IgnoreRest
def "I'll run"() { ... }
----

[source,groovy]
----
@spock.lang.IgnoreIf({ os.windows })
def "I'll run everywhere but on Windows"() { ... }
----

[source,groovy]
----
@spock.lang.Requires({ os.windows })
def "I'll only run on Windows"() { ... }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
To make predicates easier to read and write, +
the following properties are available inside the closure:

- `sys` A map of all system properties
- `env` A map of all environment variables
- `os` Information about the operating system +
  (see `spock.util.environment.OperatingSystem)`
- `jvm` Information about the JVM +
  (see `spock.util.environment.Jvm`)
--


=== Timeout

To fail a feature method, fixture, or class +
that exceeds a given execution duration, +
use `spock.lang.Timeout`

[source,groovy]
----
@Timeout(10)
class TimedSpec extends Specification {
    def "I fail after ten seconds"() { ... }
    def "Me too"() { ... }

    @Timeout(value = 250, unit = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
    def "I fail much faster"() { ... }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
When applied to a feature method, +
the timeout is per execution of one iteration, +
excluding time spent in fixture methods.

Applying `Timeout` to a spec class +
has the same effect as applying it to each feature +
that is not already annotated with Timeout, +
excluding time spent in fixture methods.

When a timeout is reported to the user, +
the stack trace shown reflects the execution stack +
of the test framework when the timeout was exceeded.
--


=== Stepwise

To execute features in the order that they are declared, +
use `spock.lang.Stepwise`

[source,groovy]
----
@Stepwise
class RunInOrderSpec extends Specification {
    def "I run first"()  { ... }
    def "I run second"() { ... }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
`Stepwise` only affects the class carrying the annotation; +
not sub or super classes. +

Features after the first failure are skipped.
--


=== Title and Narrative

To attach a natural-language name to a spec, +
use `spock.lang.Title`

[source,groovy]
----
@Title("This is easy to read")
class ThisIsHarderToReadSpec { ... }
----

To attach a natural-language description to a spec, +
use `spock.lang.Narrative`

[source,groovy]
----
@Narrative(""""
As a user
I want foo
So that bar
""")
class GiveTheUserFooSpec { ... }
----


=== Subject

To indicate one or more subjects of a spec, +
use `spock.lang.Subject`

[source,groovy]
----
@Subject([Foo, Bar])
class MySpec { ... }
----

`Subject` can be applied to fields and local variables

[source,groovy]
----
@Subject
Foo myFoo
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
`Subject` currently has only informational purposes.
--


=== Issue

To indicate that a feature or spec +
relates to one or more issues in an external tracking system, +
use `spock.lang.Issue`

[source,groovy]
----
@Issue("http://my.issues.org/FOO-1")
class MySpec {
    @Issue("http://my.issues.org/FOO-2")
    def "Foo should do bar"() { ... }

    @Issue(["http://my.issues.org/FOO-3",
            "http://my.issues.org/FOO-4"])
    def "I have two related issues"() { ... }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
`Issue` currently has only informational purposes.
--


=== Use

To activate one or more Groovy categories +
within the scope of a feature method or spec, +
use `spock.util.mop.Use`

[source,groovy]
----
class ListExtensions {
    static avg(List list) { list.sum() / list.size() }
}

class MySpec extends Specification {
    @Use(listExtensions)
    def "can use avg() method"() {
        expect:
        [1, 2, 3].avg() == 2
    }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This can be useful for stubbing of dynamic methods,
which are usually provided by the runtime environment
(e.g. Grails). It has no effect when applied to a helper
method. However, when applied to a spec class,
it will also affect its helper methods.
--

=== ConfineMetaClassChanges

To confine meta class changes to the scope of a
feature method or spec class, +
use `spock.util.mop.ConfineMetaClassChanges`

[source,groovy]
----
@Stepwise
class FooSpec extends Specification {
    @ConfineMetaClassChanges
    def "I run first"() {
        when:
        String.metaClass.someMethod = { delegate }

        then:
        String.metaClass.hasMetaMethod('someMethod')
    }

    def "I run second"() {
        when:
        "Foo".someMethod()

        then:
        thrown(MissingMethodException)
    }
}
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
When applied to a spec class, +
the meta classes are restored to the state +
that they were in before `setupSpec()` was executed, +
after cleanupSpec() is executed.

When applied to a feature method, +
the meta classes are restored to the state +
as they were after `setup()` was executed, +
before `cleanup()` is executed.
--


=== AutoCleanup

Automatically clean up a field or property +
at the end of its lifetime +
by using `spock.lang.AutoCleanup`

[source,groovy]
----
@AutoCleanup('dispose')
@AutoCleanup(quiet = true)
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
By default, an object is cleaned up by invoking its parameterless `close()` method. +
If some other method should be called instead, override the annotation’s value attribute:

[source,groovy]
----
// invoke foo.dispose()
@AutoCleanup(“dispose”) def foo
----

If multiple fields or properties are annotated with `AutoCleanup`, +
their objects are cleaned up sequentially, +
in reverse field/property declaration order, +
starting from the most derived class +
and walking up the inheritance chain.

If a cleanup operation fails with an exception, +
the exception is reported by default, +
and cleanup proceeds with the next annotated object. +
To prevent cleanup exceptions from being reported, +
override the annotation’s `quite` attribute
--
