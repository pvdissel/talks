# Developers in control

## Abstract

Bol.com has a build automation tools team since 2012, going from installation manuals, to hundreds of manually maintained Jenkins jobs, to 5000+ generated Jenkins jobs, to fully autonomous teams.
What did we do, what are we doing, where are we going, and how are we getting there.

In this demo rich talk, I'll show you the ins- and outs, our challenges, and our approaches to keeping our growing development community happy and productive.
